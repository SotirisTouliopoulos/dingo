# Leveraging the increased statistical value of flux sampling

#### Contribution for Google Summer of Code 2024 program

## Overall             		
The project will introduce new features for further statistical analysis of the samples and visualizations generated by dingo.

These will include at least the following features:

- inference of pairwise correlated reactions
- construction of a weighted graph of the model's reactions with the correlation coefficients as weights
- annotation of these weights to the metabolic model and extraction to an annotated SBML file

All methods will be implemented in Python and merged in the dingo library.

The contributor will also run experiments with several metabolic networks to investigate the scaling of their findings.
