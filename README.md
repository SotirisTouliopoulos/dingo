# Leveraging the increased statistical value of flux sampling

#### A contribution for the Google Summer of Code 2024 program

## Overall             		
The project will introduce new features for further statistical analysis of the samples and visualizations generated by dingo.

These will include at least the following features:

- inference of pairwise correlated reactions
- construction of a weighted graph of the model's reactions with the correlation coefficients as weights
- annotation of these weights to the metabolic model and extraction to an annotated SBML file

All methods will be implemented in Python and merged in the dingo library.
